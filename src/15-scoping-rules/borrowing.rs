// Instead of passing objects by value (T), objects can be passed by reference (&T).
// The compiler statically guarantees (via its borrow checker) that references always point to valid objects.
// That is, while references to an object exist, the object cannot be destroyed.
// References allow you to refer to some value without taking ownership of it.
// A reference is like a pointer in that itâ€™s an address we can follow to access the data stored at that address; that data is owned by some other variable.
// Unlike a pointer, a reference is guaranteed to point to a valid value of a particular type for the life of that reference.
// If we don't use the reference the value is moved to the new variable (take the ownership of the value).

// This function takes ownership of a box and destroys it

  // it refers to, it is not dropped.
